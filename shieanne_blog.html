        <h4>21 FEB 2026</h4>

        <div class="subtitle">Hindi inabutan Art Pop Market :<</div>

        <p>
            We have our saturday class at CSSP Campus and we had our lunch together inside
            the classroom. Casey and Princess brought the shanghai they prepared and cooked.
            We also invited our Ethics professor to join us and she asked natalie to buy 
            ice cream for us. After class, we went to Ayala Mall while we wait for the Art Pop Market.
            We strolled inside the mall and observed different artworks. We also went to ukay-ukay near
            the venue. We waited for almost 1 and a half hour but we suddenly felt the wave of drowsiness.
            At the end, we just end up going home to rest.

        <p>
           My teammate invited me to have football training with DNHS at the commencement ground.
           She also mentioned that the FRIENDSHIP FC coach is the one who will train us. I invited
           my friend, Marley to come with me so we have something to put in our blog activity and
           so she can learn new skills for the upcoming Olympics 2026.  I was excited because I can
           now play again after 3 weeks rest due to my sprained ankle injury I got from the last futsal training.

            I woke up early and prepared for the quiz scheduled at 9:00 am. Our professor messaged us that
            she can't meet us today so I just invited my girlfriend to eat lunch with me at my boarding house.
            In the afternoon, I started my Networking lab activity. I had a hard time downloading the video material
            uploaded by our professor due to its large size. I asked my friend, Casey to help me send the video to me
            via telegram and messenger. I finished my activity around 10 pm with her help and I am very thankful to
            have a friend like her.

        <p>
            I went to school early to choose a topic for our Information Management activity. After that, we attended
            our Networking class in B4. We had lunch at the CS canteen and then went to the library to prepare for our
            IM quiz. We had to return to the office because I was supposed to take the quiz there since I had forgotten
            my laptop. We waited for almost three hours, but there was still no update about the quiz. Meanwhile, my
            friend suggested going swimming the next day, since there were no classes until Friday. However, I doubted
            it would happen since it hadn't been planned properly. While we were discussing this, our professor messaged
            us to say that he couldn't meet us and would reschedule the quiz. My friends went home, and I went to the
            commencement ground to play softball with my teammate.

        <div class="subtitle">Wow, natuloy nga :0</div>

        <p>
            Today, I woke up late and remembered that my friend had planned a swimming trip. I checked my phone and saw
            that I had missed five calls from Mishli. I checked the group chat and saw that they were already on their way.
            I spent a lot of time getting ready because I was supposed to head home after swimming. When I arrived at the
            venue, Mishli hadn't arrived yet. We waited for her before taking pictures and eating lunch. We also filmed
            TikTok videos and discussed a lot of things. Mishli gave us swimming lessons, which was helpful since most
            of us aren't strong swimmers. Those lessons will benefit us in our Pathfit 3 class. I consider this day to be
            the happiest of my week, and I realized how lucky I am to have friends like them. After swimming, I headed back
            home on a two-hour jeepney ride.

            Today, I started the lab activity in Information Management. It took me a lot of time finishing the ERD activity. After that, I invited my friends

            Today, I practiced some songs on my guitar because we were invited to perform at BioNights on March 27. Me and my partner, Marley also worked finishing on
          the blog activity so we can have more time for ourselves.
