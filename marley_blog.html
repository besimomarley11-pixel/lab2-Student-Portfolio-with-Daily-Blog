        <h4>21 FEB 2026</h4>

        <div class="subtitle">Saturday class??!!</div>

        <p>
            Today, we had our UTS class in the morning and Ethics in the afternoon.
            I was 10 minutes late to our morning class because I woke up late.
            The good thing was that the class hadn’t started yet, so I didn’t miss anything.
            After class, I went straight home to sleep because I didn’t get enough rest
            since our class was too early. When I woke up, it was already time for dinner.
            After dinner, I did some activities and then went to bed.

        <div class="subtitle">Walang pasok pero my training!!!</div>

        <p>
          I woke up late today because I didn’t have any classes, 
          and my football training was scheduled to start at 3 PM.
          I got out of bed around 12 PM and started preparing for 
          training at BU grounds. I went to BU commencement ground
          around 4 PM because I waited for my friend. It was tiring,
        but I had so much fun training with my friends. I feel lucky
        to have such a dedicated and fun coach. After training, 
        I headed home, rested for a while, and reviewed for the upcoming quiz the next day.

        <p>
            I woke up early to review for our supposed quiz at 1 PM,
             but our professor informed us that she couldn’t meet us that day.
              So, I decided to work on our networking activity and review
               for our IM quiz scheduled for tomorrow instead.

        <div class="subtitle">Canceled quiz, AGAIN??!!tara outing! 
</div>

        <p>
            Today, we had a ftf class at 10 AM and a quiz at 1 PM, 
            but once again, the quiz was canceled due to our professor’s 
            emergency meeting. Instead, we were tasked to find a research 
            topic in the faculty room for our IM activity. Before choosing
             my topic, my friends and I suddenly planned to go swimming the next day. 
             It was so spontaneous, and I didn’t expect it to happen because we 
             already had many outing plans that never pushed through. 
             I was assigned to bring street food, so I went to the market 
             to buy ingredients that I would cook the next day.

        <p>
            Today was the day my friends and I went swimming. 
            Since I was assigned to bring street food, I woke up at 8 AM to cook. 
            I asked my friend/boardmate to help me prepare the sauce because 
            I really like how he makes it, and I was glad he agreed. 
            While he was cooking, I prepared my things and took a bath because my friends
            were already at the resort. I arrived around 11 AM, and they were ready to swim
            while we waited for our friend Mishli to arrive so we could eat together. 
            After eating, we swam and made some TikTok videos. I had so much fun today—spending
            time with friends feels like a great escape from academic stress.

        <p>
            I didn’t get the chance to take a photo today because I was busy working on an activity for our IM subject since it was the deadline. I started working on it around 11 AM but finished at 9 PM because my friend asked me to accompany her to the tailor. After that, we grabbed some birria and coffee. Then I headed home to complete the activity.

        <p>
            Today, I woke up feeling so happy because we finally had Wi-Fi again after a week without internet. I felt more focused on finishing this website. I continued coding at 12 PM after brunch. Later, I did my laundry, and afterward, I had siomai and fries for merienda. After eating, I went back to coding and worked on finishing our duo project with my partner, Shieanne.
